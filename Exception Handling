# ðŸ§© Exception Handling in Java using `throws`

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is `throws`?

The `throws` keyword in Java is used **in a method declaration** to specify that the method **might throw certain exceptions**, and the **caller of the method** is responsible for handling them.

In short:

> `throws` is used to declare exceptions â€” not handle them.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Syntax

```java
returnType methodName(parameters) throws ExceptionType1, ExceptionType2 {
    // method code
}
public void readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {
    FileReader fr = new FileReader(fileName);
    // code to read file
}
